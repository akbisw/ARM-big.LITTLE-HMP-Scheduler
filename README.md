# ARM-big.LITTLE-HMP-Scheduler
ARM big.LITTLE architecture has brought the benefits of low power computing and high performance with clusters of high power big processors and low power little processors. This repository consists of C code that puts different workloads on Samsung Exynos 5422 and looks at various scheduling policies that mitigates thermal throttling and tries to find the right balance between the big and the LITTLE processors.
